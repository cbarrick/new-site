title: Unnatural Language
---

Welcome to my mind! I’m starting this blog to collect and share my thoughts on Computer Science, programming, the tech industry, and cute kittens. As I grow into a better programmer and scientist, I need to be able to solidify my thoughts and ideas so that I can iterate and improve upon them. Writing in a natural language feels surprisingly unnatural to me; I’ve always felt more comfortable expressing ideas symbolically, be it through code, mathematics, or logic. But I’ve realized that limiting my expressions in such a way also limits my ability to think outside the box, and that scares me. So I’m starting this blog! This will be a place for me to hash out ideas, share my opinions and, hopefully, inspire others to pursue computer science (*it’s really really fun!*).

# About me
My parents gave me the name Christopher Stephen Barrick; I call myself **Chris**; and I go by **cbarrick** in the [series of tubes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes). I grew up in the [middle of nowhere, GA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabun_County,_Georgia), which is also one of the most beautiful places I have ever been. I was inspired to pursue computer technology as a child by the wonderful worlds of Pixar’s films and the impact and mysteries of the Internet.

I am a computer scientist, not an *engineer*, not a *developer*; I am a **scientist**. (Though I greatly enjoy both engineering and science, and I don’t exclude engineering as a career path.) I currently study both Computer Science and Cognitive Science as an undergrad at the University of Georgia, and I plan to continue my studies into graduate school.

My dream is to create the best programming language yet. I want to bridge the gap between the system compiled languages and the high-level interpreted ones; I want to make a language that can be used full stack, be used easily by both computer engineers and traditionally non-programmers. I want expressability and performance to not be mutually exclusive. But most of all, I know that no one person can achieve that much alone, so I want to study and work with the computer science community to push the limits of computer programming.

I also like kittens, nature, food, and friends. Computers are my passion, but happiness is my goal. When I was 16 or so, my father explained to me that happiness is the best aspect of life  and that the best way he could see to be happy is finding a way to survive by doing what you would be doing anyway. In my case, that’s playing with technology. And like my father, I believe that everyone deserves to be happy. In computer science especially, we have a huge diversity problem. Women and Girls are told that technology is a “guy thing”, and many are never given a chance to be happy in the same way as myself. I think the key to bringing happiness and excitement in technology to everyone is to improve education and change the culture. So I hope to be a role model for anyone interested in tech. (Though, being a white male makes that pretty difficult… yet another hard problem for me to solve.) So, as a first step, I dedicate this paragraph to all the girls out there who want to grow up to be scientists. Hopefully, once I accomplish something important, this paragraph will turn out to mean something more than a collection of words on some kid’s blog.

# About the name
A code snippet is a fragment of code design to illustrate a specific purpose. Often code authors write snippets to explain concepts by means of examples or to help themselves design intuitive APIs. Blogging serves a similar purpose. It provides me the opportunity to collect and improve my thoughts and to share my discoveries. Hence, these entries are my *Snippets of Thought*.

# About the site
This site is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on [Github](http://pages.github.com). The layout is based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) by Mark Otto, cleaned up and customized by myself. I’ve written the code in [Atom](http://atom.io) and the English in [Writer Pro](http://writer.pro), all on my trusty MacBook.
